### Objective
The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes or has high likelihood of having it.
### About Dataset
The dataset which was originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration from an oral glucose tolerance test
- Blood-Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- Skin-Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/ (height in m) ^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- Age: Age (in years) of the individual observation
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) response/outcome/target/ Y. class value 1 is interpreted as "tested positive for diabetes"
### Central Questions
• Can the likelihood that a person has diabetes be predicted based on the given diagnostic predictors?  
• Which of the given predictors are significant in predicting diabetes in a patient?  
• How does each significant predictor influence the likelihood of a diabetes diagnosis?
